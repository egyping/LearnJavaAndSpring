 -- How Class A take access to Class B

(1) Class A create it in the constructor
public class A {
    private B bClass;
    public A() {
    bClass = new B();
        }
}
(2) someone out of A create it and pass it to A
and this is what spring take care of it
public class A {
    private B b;
    public A(B bDependency) {
    this.b = bDependency;
        }
}
